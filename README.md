# Stars
Windows Forms application for drawing a starfield.

# Why is it on GitHub
This project is on GitHub mostly for archival purposes. I figured that it would be a more natural fit than keeping a ZIP file somewhere.

# What is the future of this project
Currently I have no plans of developing it further.

# How to build and run it
Open the `Stars.sln` file with Visual Studio 2019 or later, then press the 'Start' button, or hit F5 to run.
